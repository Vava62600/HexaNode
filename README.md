## üß† About the Project

**HexaNode** is a modular, web-based operating system designed for servers, combining the functionalities of Proxmox, TrueNAS Core, and Docker into a unified, open-source, modern, and user-friendly platform.

It allows managing:
- Virtual machines (QEMU/KVM),
- Docker containers,
- Storage (ZFS, EXT4, NTFS, USB drives, RAID),
- Network services (reverse proxy, firewall, VLAN),
- Home automation (Home Assistant and others),
- System services and users,
- Application deployment via a web AppStore.

HexaNode is built for enthusiasts, makers, developers, and system administrators who want **maximum control with a modern UI**.
